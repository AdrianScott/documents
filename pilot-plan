Steps to get pilot done, need items, dependencies
 - we can create issues from this, this document is for sketching out plans and brainstorming...
 
 
 Get proposals from 2-3 video producers in panama for both 1) pilot and 2) regular season, including
  - budgets
  - timing, lead time, calendar availability vs other projects producer has on calendar
  
 Market research, should we talk to:
  - crypto projects
  - ICO investors
  - people interested in ICOs but not yet investors
  - other target viewers
  
 Script / pilot content development:
  - how will we communicate story, human angle, interactions of personalities
  - do different whales compete with each other?
 
 Scheduling:
  - lead time for production
  - sync-ing up calendar for availability of Whales, especially non-Panama Whales
  - travel sheduling, lead-time, ticket purchase
  
 Guld dependency
  - guld timeline, tech requirements if any, etc.
  
 Financing
