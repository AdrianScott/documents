# Whale Tank

Peer to peer startups pitch their projects to a group of cryptocurrency experts. The audience invests in the ICOs.

### Finances

##### Revenue

The show will have two revenue streams: advertising, and equity (i.e. ICO coins) in the pitching projects.

Advertising is pretty straightforward; run ads on the website, youtube, and other hosting providers. This may become significant, but is likely to start out as the smaller stream.

Equity is the most significant and interesting revenue stream for Whale Tank. Each project that goes on the show should be required to commit some equity to the Whale Tank fund. There could be performance triggers, as well, for instance, an extra bonus if they meet a fundraising goal during the broadcast.

##### Costs

Costs will be 99% personnel. There should be 3-5 whales, and a production team of 1-2. To simplify the accounting on unknown revenues, these should be paid shares of the revenue, rather than fixed salaries. Other costs will be website design, hosting, and maintenance, and possibly some studio equipment.
