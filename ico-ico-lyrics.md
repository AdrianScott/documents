My banker and your banker were sit-tin' by the fire.
My banker told your grand-ma: "I'm gon-na set your cash on fire."

Talk-in' 'bout, Hey now ! Hey now ! I-co, I-co, one-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-né, jock-a-mo fee na-né

Look at my whale all dressed in red I-co, I-co, one-day.
I bet-cha five dol-lars he'll kill your plans, jock-a-mo fee na-né

Talk-in' 'bout, Hey now ! Hey now ! I-co, I-co, one-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-né, jock-a-mo fee na-né

My coin dev and your coin dev were
Sit-tin' by the fire. - My coin dev told
Your coin dev: "I'm gon-na set your coin on fire."

Talk-in' 'bout, Hey now ! Hey now ! I-CO, I-CO, one-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-né, jock-a-mo fee na-né

See that whale all wild and free? I-CO, I-CO, one-day.
He's not a whale, he's a fredom ma-chine
Jock-a mo fee na-né

Talk-in' 'bout, hey now! Hey now! I-co, I-co, one-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-né, jock-a-mo fee na-né
